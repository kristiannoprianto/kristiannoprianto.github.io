# Hi, I'm Kristian Noprianto

Software Developer • Real-Time Systems • Scientific Computing • Backend
& Frontend Engineering

## About Me

I build end-to-end software systems---from backend APIs and scientific
computation modules to user-facing web applications and real-time
monitoring systems. My work spans geophysics, research software, data
processing, and full-stack development.\
I enjoy solving complex problems, designing clean architectures, and
collaborating in technical teams.
